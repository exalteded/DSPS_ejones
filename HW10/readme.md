I worked in a group with Victor Ramirez, Micheal Richardson, Liam Kelley, Shea fitzgerald, Allie deabreau.
Micheal did the groundwork and most of the code for part 1,
Everyone worked together for part 2 and 3 but the refinement of the hyperparameters in part 3 shea deserves a shout-out
for developing code that worked to go through and find the best paramaters as opposed to my own code which did not work.
Shea and victor worked on part 4 the most.
