I worked in a group with Liam kelly, Allie deabreau, Shea fitzgerald, Victor ramirez, and Micheal Richardson for this project. 

Victor set up part 1 and everyone ingested the data on thier own
Everyone worked together on part 3 but shea eventually got the phase-folding and I used his solution for it.
Shea victor and I worked on the binning and shea figured it out after our meeting.

Victor Liam and I worked on finishing task V of the lab
Liam got the first bit and I got the last bit
